### API Endpoints
> **GET Mapping** http://localhost:8081/findByPrefix/{prefix}  - Get all names with given prefix

#### Input validation:
The {prefix} must contain al least 2 chars and at most 10 chars
### Loading data into H2
In this exercise The requirement was to avoid the app to be aware about the file (provided /data/Manes.csv, therefore I choose to load it via H2 console<BR>

1. > DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ENTITY;
2. > CREATE TABLE ENTITY AS SELECT NAME, SUBSTRING(NAME,1,1) AS INITIAL FROM CSVREAD('C:\data\Names.csv');
3. > CREATE INDEX INDEX_INITIAL ON ENTITY (INITIAL);

Notes:
- Index has been added to the table in order to improve the performance while fetching the data from the table.
  run SET TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT 3; can validate if the query optimizer is using the index or not.
- Run the above after initial the app.

### TODO
- Access Control
- Swagger
- Add more tests
